# Auxiliaty Quantum Master Equation

This aims to write a python implementation of the dual boson auxiliary master
equation first described in [1](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.101.235439).

## Aims

1. For given hybridization and auxiliaty system size and geometry, return
   parameter set that minimizes the auxiliaty hybridization function
2. For a given auxiliary system the Hilbert space and fermionic operators
   should be set up.
3. Setup/include up an efficient Lindbladian solver should be set up.
4. Implement three and four point correlation functions.
   (maybe this can be done using Igor Krevienkos code)
