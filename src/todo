Correlator Class:

    TODO: Restructure:
        - Correlators should be a interface class
        - a Solver should be supplied to the class:
                i)  getting the steady state density of state
                ii) get correlators: i)   ED
                                    ii)  Lanczos/Arnoldi
                                    iii) Tensornetwork/MPS/DMRG

            -> should the solvers be children of the correlator class or
                should the correlator have an attribute
                !! Best use attributes -> can be used independently of rest!!

        - what should it do?
            - have subspace Lindbladian
            - have the subspace creator and annihilator
            - set everything before solving expectation values
                - ordering and prefactors of expectation values
                - sectors
        - The rest should be moved in a ED solver class which





Dual Trilex:
    auxiliary quantities:
        [X] get green's function
        [X] get susceptibility
            -> in file correlators
            -> equivalent to green's function but with
                <(c^{\dagger}\simga c)(c^{\dagger}\simga c)> - <(c^{\dagger}\simga c)><(c^{\dagger}\simga c)>
        [ ] set U for different channel
            -> find how they are defined
        [ ] get bosonic bath

    Dual quantities:
        [ ] get bare dual green's function
        [ ] get bare dual bosonic green's function
        [ ] get dual bosonic hybridization
        [ ] get full dual bosonic green's function
        [ ] get dual self-energy
        [ ] get full dual green's function

    impurity quantities:
        [ ] get green's function

Auxiliary_system_parameter:
    [ ] Should be able to set target impurity site at beginning of in the
        middel of the auxiliary problem, for now the impurity site is
        positioned in the middel by default.
    [ ] In the non-particle-hole symmetric case Gamma1 and Gamma2 are
        Independent
    [ ] Later Extend this to multiorbital case
